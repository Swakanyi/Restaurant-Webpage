            <h2>Our Story - The History of Dine with CE&E</h2>
            <p>CE&E Restaurant was born out of a shared dream between three siblings - Chloe,Emma and Ethan; who
                believed that dining should feel like coming home, even in the most elegant of settings.</p>
            <p>Growing up in different corners of the world, the trio spent their early years exploring vibrant oood
                cultures, from Chloe's rustic countryside kitchen, to Emma's fine dining experiences abroad, to Ethan's
                street food inspired flavors. It was during their travels and gatherings that the idea for CE&E
                Restaurant began to simmer. In 2022, they brought that dream to life; opening a space where luxury meets
                warmth, where families could gather, friends could toast and every meal felt like a memory in the
                making.</p>
            <p>Set in the heart of the city but designed with the charm of a countryside retreat, Dine with CE&E
                combines elegant interiors with a comforting homestyle menu. Today, CE&E is more than just a restaurant
                - a place of connection, community and culinary celebration. </p>
